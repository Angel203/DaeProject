Balancing Act: How I Stand Strong as a Single Parent of Four

Hi, I’m Angelica Marí Cruz, a 35-year-old single mom to four amazing kids aged 13, 11, 7, and 5. My life is a whirlwind of dance rehearsals, work projects, school drop-offs, and endless laundry loads, all while trying to be the best mom I can be. Juggling two jobs, teaching dance, and managing a household isn’t always a piece of cake, but somehow, I make it work. How do I stand, you ask? Let me take you behind the scenes of my daily hustle.

~The Pull in Every Direction~

Each of my kids is at a different stage in their lives, which means I’m constantly shifting gears. From dealing with teenage drama to navigating the curious questions of my youngest, my days are a non-stop balancing act. It’s like being on a dance floor where the music never stops, and the choreography changes every five minutes. There are moments when I feel like I’m being pulled in a million different directions, and honestly, sometimes I am. But I’ve learned to embrace the chaos with a smile and a lot of deep breaths.

~The Heart of My Home~

After a long day of work and teaching, there’s nothing I love more than coming home, cooking dinner, and sitting down with my kids for a meal. It’s our time to connect, laugh, and talk about our day. It’s in these moments that I feel the most grounded. No matter how hectic life gets, I always make time for these simple yet powerful moments. They remind me why I do what I do and keep me going when things get tough.

~My Time to Unwind~
Yes, I’m a mom, but I’m also me. Finding time to unwind and recharge is essential. Whether it’s curling up with a good book, binge-watching my favorite drama, soaking up some sun, or just catching some much-needed sleep, I make sure to carve out a little time for myself each day. It’s not always easy, but I’ve learned that taking care of myself is just as important as taking care of my kids. After all, a happy mom makes for a happy home.
 ~How Do I Stand?~

So, how do I stand strong amidst all the demands of life? The answer is simple: I don’t do it alone. I thank God every day for the strength He gives me. It’s His grace that keeps me going when I feel like I can’t take another step. My kids give me purpose, but it’s my faith that gives me the power to keep going. It’s not always easy, but with a little bit of faith, a lot of love, and a dash of humor, I manage to make it through each day.

Life as a single mom is challenging, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. I wouldn’t trade it for anything. My journey may be tough, but it’s filled with love, laughter, and a whole lot of dancing—both on and off the stage.
